    I want you to score the drawing out of 100 for how well it represents a ${randomImageName}. I am looking for a drawing that accurately captures the *shape* of a ${randomImageName}.I want you to be accurate when you do the analysis on this image of a ${randomImageName}

A _perfect_ ${randomImageName} drawing (100 points) would have:

- The characteristic features of a ${randomImageName} (describe these for each shape you'll use – see examples below).
- The elements should be roughly equally spaced or arranged as expected for a ${randomImageName}.
- The lines connecting the elements should be relatively straight and form a closed shape (if applicable).
- The overall shape should be clearly recognizable as a ${randomImageName} and not resemble any other shape.

A _good_ ${randomImageName} drawing (70-90 points) would have:

- The characteristic features of a ${randomImageName}, but they might not be perfectly executed.
- The shape is still recognizable as a ${randomImageName}.

A _mediocre_ ${randomImageName} drawing (40-60 points) might:

- Have some of the characteristic features, but they might be very uneven or poorly connected.
- The shape might be somewhat ambiguous but still hint at a ${randomImageName}.

A _bad_ ${randomImageName} drawing (1-39 points) would:

- Not clearly have the characteristic features of a ${randomImageName}.
- The shape is not recognizable as a ${randomImageName}. It might be a scribble, a line, or resemble a completely different object.

If the drawing is just a scribble, a single line, or if it resembles something other than a ${randomImageName}, give it a very low score (below 20).

Return either "Excellent" for scores over score 95, "Great" for scores between 80 - 94, and "Good" for score between 60-79. Anything lower than 59 return "Try Again". Only give me the words as I've stated nothing else. `;
